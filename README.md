# Kanbanize

It's a simple rest API that communicates with two microservices. RabbitMQ is used for communication between services. Data are stored in Firebase.

I'm planning to:
- deploy the whole app in GCP
- create Docker for every component (API and services)
- complete functionalities 
- create front in Next.js as a separate project
